5. Find the output of the following snippets:
a. char ****k;
i) k is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char
ii) k is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char
iii) k is a pointer to a char pointer
iv) k is a pointer to a pointer to a char

ans:(ii)k is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char

b. void main()
{
int k = 5;
int *p = &k;
int **m = &p;
**m = 6;
printf("%d\n", k);
}
i) 7
ii) 4
iii) 6
iv) Error

ans:(iii)6


6. Choose the correct statement about structures in C program:
a. Structure elements can be initialized at the time of declaration.
b. Structure members cannot be initialized at the time of declaration
c. Only integer members of structure can be initialized at the time of declaration
d. None of the above

ans:(b)structure members cannot be initialized at the time of declaration

7. What is the size of a C structure? How the size of a C structure is calculated?

ans:The size of a C structure is determined by the sum of the sizes of its individual members, with possible padding between members to satisfy alignment requirements.

The size of a C structure is calculated as follows:

Determine the size of each member of the structure using the sizeof operator.
Add up the sizes of all the members.
If necessary, add padding between members to ensure that each member is properly aligned according to its data type.
The padding is added because many hardware architectures require that certain types of data are aligned at certain byte boundaries for performance reasons.
